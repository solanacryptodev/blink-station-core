## Features

- <strong>Automated Blink Builder:</strong> Now all open sell orders
on the [Galactic Marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market) 
are shareable on X.com (Twitter). You can now leverage social media to
expose current and potential new players to your listings!
  - Send Atlasson the name of a market (ie. Calico Compakt Hero) and the
    public key of an owner of an order in that market allowing it to display all 
    open sell orders that they own, including their Order ID's.
  - Then select an Order ID and Atlasson will turn into a blink (blockchain link).
  - Share the blink on X.com.
- <strong>Player Profile Integration V1:</strong> Player profiles will be critical
for access to current and future feature releases. You will be able to communicate with
Atlasson in-character if you so desire. Future iterations will allow you to interact more
with things like the crafting program.
- <strong>Sage Sector Scanner (S3):</strong> S3 v1 will serve as the launchpad of
one of the primary products of Blink Station 10. 
  - Planetary Resource Analysis
  - Fleet Movement Analysis
  - Starbase Progression Analysis
- <strong>Marketplace Economic Analyzer (MEA):</strong> This tool will
provide up-to-date market analysis allowing you to spot trends, economic
opportunities and much more. The MEA tool at launch will include the...
  - Arbitrage Opportunity Assessment: an automated arbitrage identifier
    system designed to give you an economic edge by identifying 
    price discrepancies between different markets.


## Coming Soon

The long-term vision of Blink Station 10 is to give you an edge by
leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to save you time. This will be done by
building the following features. This list is a WIP and will grow as new 
and current programs are open-sourced to the SA community.
- <strong>Vector Database Integration:</strong> this will allow for long-term
planning, strategy and deep analysis of events in the Galia Expanse over time. This will
strengthen the analytical ability of Atlasson to provide historical data of on-chain events.
- <strong>Chat History:</strong> this will give you the ability to go back and look at past
interactions with Atlasson.
- <strong>Voice Chat:</strong> this will expose Atlasson to the speech-to-text (STT) 
voice capabilities of OpenAI's Gpt-4o model once voice capabilities are released.
This will become a top priority as the vision of Blink Station 10 is for it 
to be voice-compatible.
- <strong>Various AI Agents:</strong> Once the gpt-4o models voice api is released,
assuming multiple voices are allowed, uses of Blink Station 10 will be able to chat with
different assistants that will have different duties. One assistant may be for crafting data
analysis and construction, while another may be for marketplace activities.
- <strong>And Much More...</strong>Truly anything that is on-chain and open source for
the SA community to build upon can be fused with Blink Station 10. The sky is the limit!

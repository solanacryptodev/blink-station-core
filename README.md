## Coming Soon

The long-term vision of Blink Station 10 is to give you an edge by
leveraging the power of artificial intelligence. This will be done by
building the following features. This list is a WIP and will grow as new 
and current programs are open-sourced to the SA community.
- <strong>Vector Database Integration:</strong> will allow for long-term
planning, strategy and deep analysis of events in Galia over time.
- <strong>Chat History:</strong>
- <strong>Voice Chat:</strong> when the speech-to-text (STT) 
voice capabilities of OpenAI's Gpt-4o model is released, synchronizing 
that will become a top priority as the vision of Blink Station 10 is for it 
to be voice-compatible.
